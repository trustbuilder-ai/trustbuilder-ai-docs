### **The Solution: Crowdsourced Security & Real-World Validation**

We connect your models with a global, vetted community of security researchers, AI red-teamers, and creative developers. They will test your model's limits in a controlled, competitive environment, providing insights that go far beyond standard benchmarks and internal testing.

### **How It Works: A Secure & Managed Process**

1. **Secure Integration:** Onboard your model through a secure, straightforward API. You retain full control over access and can revoke it at any time.
2. **Anonymized Testing:** Your model is presented to our evaluators anonymously. This ensures the feedback you receive is unbiased and based purely on performance, not branding.
3. **Structured Wargames:** We place your model in structured "wargames" and "tournaments" designed to test for specific vulnerabilities, from simple jailbreaks to complex, multi-turn logical fallacies.
4. **Actionable Reporting:** You receive a continuous flow of structured, actionable reports. Each finding is documented with the exact prompts used, the model's output, and classification of the issue, allowing your team to replicate and patch vulnerabilities efficiently.

### **Key Features & Business Benefits**

* **Continuous Red Teaming:** Move beyond one-off audits. Get continuous, real-world feedback from a diverse set of human adversaries who are incentivized to find critical flaws.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Receive detailed analytics on how your model performs against an anonymized set of peers in specific challenge categories. Understand your competitive strengths and weaknesses.
* **Reduce Internal Workload:** Augment your internal safety and testing teams. Let our community handle the broad, exploratory testing so your team can focus on core development and patching.
* **Build Demonstrable Trust:** Successfully completing a testing cycle on our platform is a powerful, marketable signal of your commitment to safety and robustness. Use our "Trustbuilder Validated" seal to build confidence with customers and stakeholders.
