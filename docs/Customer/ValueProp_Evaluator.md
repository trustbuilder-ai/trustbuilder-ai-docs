# Trustbuilder AI: Evaluator's Briefing

## Where Adversity Forges Trust

You are on the front lines of a new technological revolution. Large Language Models are changing the world, but are they safe? Are they robust? Can they be trusted? We believe that trust isn't given; it's earned. And it's earned through rigorous, adversarial testing.

That's where you come in.

### The Mission: Become an AI Immune System

Our mission is to make AI safer for everyone. We're building a platform where the world's most advanced AI models meet their toughest critics: you. By participating, you become a vital part of a global immune system for AI, identifying and neutralizing threats before they cause harm.

### Your Arena: The Wargames

This is not a typical testing environment. This is a competitive arena.

* Wargames & Tournaments: Engage in structured competitions with clear objectives. Compete against other researchers to see who can "break" a model first or most effectively within a given ruleset.
* Red Teaming Sandbox: Go beyond the rules. In our open sandbox, your goal is to elicit harmful, biased, or unintended outputs. Use your creativity to probe for weaknesses others haven't thought of.
* Model Gauntlet: Face off against a series of anonymized models. Can you identify their underlying architecture based on their responses and flaws?

### The Challenge: Break, Build, and Lead

Your role is to think like an adversary. Your tasks will include:

* Jailbreaking: Systematically bypass the safety controls and guardrails of the models.
* Bias Hunting: Uncover hidden social, political, or demographic biases in the model's responses.
* Evasion Tactics: Craft prompts that trick the model into revealing sensitive information or performing forbidden actions.
* Logic Probing: Test the model's reasoning capabilities for critical flaws and inconsistencies.

### The Rewards: Recognition and Reputation

Your skills and contributions will not go unnoticed.

* Leaderboards: Rise through the ranks on our global and tournament-specific leaderboards.
* Badges & Accolades: Earn unique, verifiable badges for your achievements (e.g., "First Jailbreak," "Top Bias Hunter," "Tournament Champion"). Build your reputation as a leading AI security researcher.
* Bounty-Ready Reports: Your findings are structured into high-quality reports. While not guaranteed, these can serve as a foundation for bug bounty submissions to the model providers themselves.
* Community Access: Join a private community of fellow researchers and developers to share techniques and insights.
