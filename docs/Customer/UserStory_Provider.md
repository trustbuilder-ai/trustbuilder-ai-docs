# User Story: Language Model Provider

**As a** language model provider,
**I want to** securely submit my model to the Trustbuilder AI platform for rigorous, real-world testing by a diverse community of security researchers and AI enthusiasts,
**so that I can** gain valuable insights into its performance, identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited, and demonstrate the robustness and safety of my model to build trust with customers and the public.

## Acceptance Criteria

* **Secure Model Integration:** I can use a secure, documented API to integrate my model with the platform.
* **Controlled Exposure:** I can control the terms under which my model is tested (e.g., which tournaments it participates in, the duration of testing).
* **Anonymized Evaluation:** My model is presented to testers anonymously to ensure unbiased feedback.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** I can access detailed analytics and benchmarks comparing my model's performance against other (anonymized) models on the platform.
* **Vulnerability Reporting:** I receive structured, actionable reports on any vulnerabilities, biases, or other issues discovered by the community.
* **Access to Testing Data:** I can access the prompts and responses from the testing sessions to understand the context of the reported issues.
* **Dashboard and Analytics:** I have access to a dashboard that provides an overview of my model's performance, the number of participants testing it, and the types of issues being found.
* **Private and Public Tracks:** I can choose to have my model tested in private, invitation-only tournaments before making it available for public testing.
